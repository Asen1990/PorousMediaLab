# PorousMediaLab

Toolbox for 1D reactive transport modeling in porous media aimed on easeness of use for user without computational background.

For the example, have a look of simulation of [freeze/thawing cycles](https://github.com/biogeochemistry/PorousMediaLab/blob/master/FT_column_example.ipynb) in saturated soil.
